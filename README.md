# Portfolio-Landing

##This is a portfolio landing page for my current/future projects. The purpose of this website is to show people the my current skill level in web design using HTML and CSS. This landing page will improve with time as I learn more efficiently ways to code and lay-out webpages. The outline of what I have going for this is as my portfolio will continue to grow and improve, so please feel free to look at my projects and the current design then go back to the first commits I made in github to see how far I've come.


##The purpose of the website is to display all the projects I have worked on and future ones to come. The website also has information about who I am and how to contact me. The webpage itself is not permanent so try to check on it every few months as I make changes or make a completely new one once I learn more new things.
